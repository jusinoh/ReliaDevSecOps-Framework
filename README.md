  - Purpose: Promotes an environment of innovation and learning, where SLIs serveas unbiased metrics to guide team efforts and enhance system performance.

**Notes:**

- IMPLEMENT DIE MODEL IN SECURE CODING PRACTICES
- Begin to identify maturity model (i.e. what steps to start with and how to expand outward)
- When going into the release engineering phase, the application should be decoupled to enable various tests to be performed against each subsequent microservice or solution.
  - This not only will help determine if that area performs as intended, but as you transition into more system and integration engineering, you can observe how certain processes in one subsection impact the next.
  - This information is going to be very useful for troubleshooting, as you can now pinpoint issues rapidly, understand what a normal system should look like and understand how one component integrates with the next.
- Errors are bound to take place, determine what your SLO is for error rates and ensure your SLI is aligned to track that.
- Building the ability to observe the application with appropriate metrics and logs, building the application with clearly defined integrations between each component.
- When reviewing **release engineering** the following practices should be standardized:
  - Building
    - When developing, consistent builds should be used (ie. Pulling from specific, immutable, dependencies) to ensure that a consistent feature or product is being built.
      - This could be in the form of using build containers, package managers such as Maven, or local dependencies repositories.
      - Name packages after what component they support (ie. Frontend, backend, load balancing, etc.) (Google, 2017).
- During release engineering testing, these tests should test the anticipated behavior of the application or system. So, for instance, we are testing to validate that the feature or update being introduced into the application/ system does not negatively affect the performance or behavior of the intended unit (ie. CPU usage, network latency, internal system latency (system to database), etc.) (Kuefler, n.d.).
- Some follow-on items for deep dive research to expand on the framework, as it pertains to the integration of SRE practices:
  - Preparedness and disaster testing
    - Systems should behave as intended
    - Identify security gaps in the system proactively
    - Detailed requirements and design documents
      - Gather this information from the application or systems user base
      - Risk appetite!
    - Defense in depth
  - Postmortem culture
    - What occurred
    - Response effectiveness
    - After-action reporting
    - Remediation efforts
  - Automation and reduced operational overhead
  - Structured and rational decision making
  - Chaos Engineering methods

- Big Point to focus on for long-term SRE
  Principles
  - Embracing Risk
  - SLIs, SLOs, & SLAs
- Eliminating TOIL
  - Logging and Monitoring Microservices
  - Release Engineering

- Practices
  - Practicality
  - Effectiveness
  - Managing Efficiency & Security Issues/ Incidents
  - Learning From Failure/ After Action Reporting
  - Tracking Outages (if a SLO is not met, the service is downgrading towards outage)
  - Reliability Testing (test to ensure intended behavior is met)
  - Addressing Cascading Issues (domino effect; one server is impacting sending the load down the line causing more downtime)

- Management
  - When addressing management, decision making is such an important aspect when determining when an action item is considered TOIL and when it is considered necessary. Various case studies in the GOOGLE SRE book highlight that slow methodical industries that have a higher risk impact may rely on the more manual side of things, whereas lower risk impact may rely on data-driven analysis.
  - Overall, understanding when is the right time to automate and orchestrate using data-driven analysis is critical to avoid a downtime impacting the businesses bottom-line or its users.
